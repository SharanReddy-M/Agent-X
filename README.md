# Agent-X
Adaptive Traffic Signal Controller uses Reinforcement Learning with a Q-Learning agent to dynamically adjust traffic signal timings based on real-time vehicle density and waiting time. The system learns optimal signal actions over time, reducing congestion, minimizing delays, and outperforming traditional fixed-timer traffic control methods.
